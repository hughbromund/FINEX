                              Market risk is probably the most broad form of risk. Factors that effect the entire economic
                              market are market risks. When the performance of the entire market shifts in a certain direction,
                              whether due to political, social, or economic causes, we call that a market risk.

                              When it comes to risk as broad as market risk, your best bet is to diversify your portfolio. Overall
                              economic trends are out of our control so it's important to make your portfolio, and financial situation,
                              resistant to economic downturns.

                              When the Great Recession first hit in the mid 2000s, many investments began to plummet. Many low risk assets
                              such as bonds became popular investments in spite of this. With a diversified portfolio where you have a healthy
                              mix of high and low risk invements, you can feel more confident of riding out downturns such as the one in 2008.

                              Also known as an unsystematic risk, specific risks are those that effect a sector or single company.
                              When new regulations, or a change of managemet effect the company, we call that a specific risk that
                              an investor needs to weigh.

                              Specific risks are more avoidable than systematic risks. Good, quality research can help invesorts When
                              it comes to avoiding specific risks. While some events, such as faults in a product, might be unforseeable,
                              it's important to determine whether there is any looming threat to a company or sector before investing.

                              A great example of a specific risk that might have been unforseaable was the Volkswagen emission scandal. When
                              Volkswagen was forced to recall millions of vehicles and pay millions in fines, their value as an investment fell.
                              As an investor you need to be cautious because events like Volkswagen emission scandal could happen to a holding
                              in your portfolio.

                              Business Risk is simply the question of whether a company will make a profit, of whether a company's level
                              of business will rise. An easy way to measaure business risk is by quarterly reports and financial statements.

                              Business risk is the most fundamental risk to weigh when you consider investing into a specific company. You should
                              consider whether the company has seen increased or decreased profits in recent quarters, whether demand for their product
                              or service has changed, and a multitude of other levels.

                              Sears Holdings has seen its stock value decrease year over year for at least the last 5 years. As an investor, you might
                              have done your research and noted that their quarterly earnings reports had shown decreased sales revenue. You might have
                              also determined that overall demand for their model of sales had decreased in light of companies like Amazon. Your research
                              would have prevented you from assuming a large business risk in Sears.

                              Credit risk is the risk that a borrower will be unable to pay back either the principle or its interest. There
                              are two primary types of credit risk sources: government bonds and corporate bonds. Government bonds usually have less risk
                              and lower yield while corporate bonds generaly have a higher yield but higher risk of defaulting.

                              Credit risk is all about how much risk you are willing to take on. Bond ratings are readily available from places
                              such as Stand and Poor's which can give you an idea of their risk. If you are interested in low credit risk government
                              bonds might be better suited for you. In the end, it's still important to diversify your portfolio to avoid concentrated risk.

                              In 2012 Greece made international headlines when it defaulted on its national debt. This example of credit risk showed how
                              large scale a national default could be. Investors had to strike a deal with the Greek government that reduced the amount owed
                              by around half.

                              Also known as geopolitical risk, it is the risk that investments could go sour because of political instability
                              or general changes in the country's politics. In certain parts of the world, it is mainly a result of conflict and military
                              control.

                              Politicl risks are difficult to hedge againsts because of how irregularly they can occur. The most common, war and terrorism,
                              are usually insured against by large multinational corporations. As an investors, it's important to be aware of where a company might
                              have significant holdings and whether that area is experiencing strife or conflict.

                              Interest rate risk is the risk that a change in the interest rates will effect the value of your investment. This is primarily
                              a concern for bondholders, where your yield and what bonds you decide to hold depends on the projected and current interest rates.

                              The simple way of reducing interest rate risk is to hold bonds of different durations. This helps alleviate risk
                              because if interest rate changes mostly effect bonds with a maturity of one year, holding bonds with longer or shorter maturities
                              will offset some of that loss.

                              Let's say that you purchase a bond from the federal government that has a maturity date of one year and pays 2% interest. If,
                              during your time holding that bond, interest rates jump to 3% from say, 1%, you've now missed out on a higher return. Instead of holding
                              a bond, you would have had a 1% higher return loaning your money out. That is interest rate risk.

                Risk is unavoidable in making investments, but that doesn't mean you should be afraid of making one. Take it into
                your own hands to learn about the market, determine what risk you're willing to assume, and diversify your portfolio.
                Investing is a great step to make your future more secure!
